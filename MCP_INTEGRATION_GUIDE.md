# MCP Client Integration Guide

## Changes Made

Based on the `app.py` file analysis, I've updated your MCP client to follow the correct async pattern. Here are the key changes:

### 1. Updated `mcp_client.py`

**Key Changes:**
- Implemented async context manager pattern (`__aenter__` and `__aexit__`)
- Uses `MultiServerMCPClient` from `langchain_mcp_adapters.client`
- Proper async initialization and cleanup
- Better error handling and status tracking

**New Features:**
- `get_status()` method for detailed client information
- `update_config()` method for dynamic configuration updates
- Proper cleanup of MCP resources

### 2. Updated `conversation_graph.py`

**Key Changes:**
- Added missing `warnings` import
- Updated MCP client usage to work with new async pattern
- Better error handling in async initialization

### 3. Usage Pattern

The new MCP client must be used as an async context manager:

```python
# Correct usage:
async def use_mcp_client():
    from src.mcp_client import mcp_client
    
    async with mcp_client as client:
        tools = client.get_tools()
        # Use tools here
        
# Or for ConversationGraph:
graph = ConversationGraph()  # Handles async initialization internally
response = graph.chat("Hello", "session-123")
await graph.cleanup()  # Important: cleanup when done
```

### 4. Configuration

The MCP client now supports the configuration format found in your `mcp_config.json`:

```python
config = {
    "zwigato-support": {
        "command": "python",
        "args": ["./mcp_server_remote.py"],
        "transport": "stdio"
    }
}
```

### 5. Testing

Two test scripts have been created:
- `test_mcp_client.py` - Tests the MCP client directly
- `test_conversation_graph.py` - Tests the full conversation graph integration

Run these to verify the integration works:

```bash
python test_mcp_client.py
python test_conversation_graph.py
```

### 6. Required Dependencies

Make sure these packages are installed:
```bash
pip install langchain-mcp-adapters
pip install langgraph
pip install langchain-core
pip install langchain-openai
pip install langchain-google-genai
pip install loguru
pip install nest-asyncio
```

### 7. Environment Variables

Set these environment variables:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
# OR
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_key
```

## Error Resolution

The main error you were seeing:
```
AttributeError: 'MCPClient' object has no attribute '__aenter__'
```

This is now fixed because:
1. The MCP client properly implements `__aenter__` and `__aexit__` methods
2. It uses the correct `MultiServerMCPClient` internally
3. The async lifecycle is properly managed

## Integration with Your Main App

To integrate with your main Streamlit app or other components:

```python
# In your main app initialization
from src.conversation_graph import ConversationGraph

# Create graph (handles MCP initialization internally)
graph = ConversationGraph()

# Use for chat
response = graph.chat(user_input, session_id)

# Cleanup when shutting down
await graph.cleanup()
```

The changes ensure compatibility with the working pattern from `app.py` while maintaining your existing architecture.
